    Use Secateur if you want to temporarily block or mute a Twitter account <em>and</em> all its followers.
  </p>

      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <h4 class="alert-heading">An administrator needs to enable your account.</h4>
        <p>
          You've logged in to Secateur, but an administrator needs to enable your access
          before you can use it to block or mute users. This is a safeguard while Secateur
          is still, essentially, a pre-alpha spare-time project.

  <h2>The basics</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Log in</strong> to secateur. Logging in connects Secateur to your Twitter account and gives it permission to block or unblock users on your behalf. </li>
      {#  <li>If you're logging in for the <strong>first time</strong>, you will also have to contact the <a href="/contact/">administrator</a> to ask them to enable your account. This is a safeguard while the project is young.</li>#}
      <li>If you don't want Secateur to block the accounts of people you follow. You can <a href="{% url "following" %}">update the list of people you follow on this page.</a></li>
      <li>Use the <strong>'Block Accounts'</strong> page to select whether to block or mute a user and/or their followers, and select a time period (in weeks).</li>
      <li>All operations Secateur takes on your behalf are logged on the 'Log' page.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As you can see, the user interface at the moment is still entirely bare-bones. It will grow more usable and flexible over time.</p>

  <h2>Disconnecting</h2>
  To immediately prevent Secateur from acting on your behalf, use the 'Disconnect' link.
